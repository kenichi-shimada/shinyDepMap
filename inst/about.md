## shinyDepMap
shinyDepMap is a web-tool to explore the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project data of the Broad Institute (version 19q3), to help users identify and characterize essential genes among all protein encoding genes. DepMap is a powerful drug discovery tool. Its <a href="https://depmap.org/portal" target="_blank"> portal website</a> provides individual genesâ€™ dependency from both CRISPR and RNAi data. We combined the CRISPR and RNAi dependency data into a unified score, and built this non-programmer biologist-friendly tool, **shinyDepMap**, which allows 1) to compare efficacy and selectivity of a gene loss across 15,847 protein-encoding genes, and 2) genes that work together in pathways or complexes.

### Usage
This web-tool can be used for the following purposes.

+ Predict the efficacy and selectivity of future drugs with a known target gene
+ Identify targets of highly selective drugs
+ Identify maximally sensitive cell lines for testing a drug
+ "Target hop", *i.e.*, navigate from an undruggable protein with the desired selectivity profile to more druggable targets with similar profiles
+ Identify novel pathways needed to cancer cell growth and survival
