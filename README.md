# shinyDepMap 
A shiny-based interactive web tool to analyze [DepMap](https://depmap.org/) data
(based on their 19q3 release). There are several options for using it:

1. [Use the public version of the tool](https://labsyspharm.shinyapps.io/depmap/)
2. [Run the tool locally in R](#run-with-r)
3. [Run the tool locally using Docker](#run-with-docker)

## Run with R

### Preparation
To launch this tool locally in R, clone or download this repository and install
the required R pacakges as follows:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("ggplot2","shiny","markdown","RColorBrewer","shinyWidgets","plotly","DT","igraph","visNetwork","tibble","shinyjs","dplyr","tidyr","yonder"))
```

### Launch the app
In the R process, modify the path to the parent directory of the source directory and run the code. 
```r
library(shiny)
setwd("/_the_parent_dir_of_the_source_dir_/")
runApp("shinyDepMap")
```

## Run with Docker 
	(to be implemented)
	An alternative to the _Run with R_ option. Run the following commands, then open
	your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888/ .

	```
	docker pull labsyspharm/shinydepmap:latest
	docker run -p 8888:8888 labsyspharm/shinydepmap:latest
	```
